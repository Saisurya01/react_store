# React Store Web App

An interactive e-commerce style store web application built with **React** that fetches product data from a dummy JSON API. Users can browse products, view details, and interact with a simple user interface.

Live demo: https://saisurya01.github.io/react_store/

## Description

This React Store is a front-end application that displays products fetched from a mock API. It demonstrates effective use of React components, state management, and asynchronous API calls. The interface allows users to view products in a catalog format with prices, images, and descriptions.

This project is ideal for understanding how to build a React SPA that consumes external APIs.
