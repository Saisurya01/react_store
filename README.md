# React Store Web App

An interactive e-commerce style store web application built with **React** that fetches product data from a dummy JSON API. Users can browse products, view details, and interact with a simple user interface.

**Live demo:** https://saisurya01.github.io/react_store/

## Description

This React Store is a front-end application that displays products fetched from a mock API. It demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and asynchronous API calls.

The interface presents products in a catalog format with images, prices, and descriptions. This project is useful for learning how to build a React single-page application that consumes external APIs.
